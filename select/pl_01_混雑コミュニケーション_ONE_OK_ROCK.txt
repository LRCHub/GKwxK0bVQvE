It's like you
Here I am
It's been since 1988
We are alive for a moment
混雑してる 毎日
あれも有りでこれも有り
挙句の果てに何でも有り? There's no option?
空想的なイミテーションが
いつだってIt's on my way
限りなく果てしない
しまいに落ちに落ちてくのさWhere are you going?
Always had some trouble
with pressure and connection
戦略的攻略は? I guess nobody knows
そうやって今日だってYou can't fool me
It's like you
Here I am
It's been since 1988
We got everything to take off now
You're thinking the same way
We fight for a moment
感覚的に毎日
アレがこうでだからこう
そんな理屈や理論だけじゃThere's no way out
突発的なイミテーションが
いつだってIt's on my way
限りなく果てしない
しまいに落ちに落ちていってYou can't go back
It's like you
Here I am
It's been since 1988
We got everything to take off now
It's like you
Here I am
It's been since 1988
I've been taking this way all the time
Taking this way again and again
We got everything to take off now
You're thinking the same way
